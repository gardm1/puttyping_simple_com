# Putty-Ping w data handler

Same as with [the other putty-ping program](https://github.com/gardm1/.putty_simple/blob/main/README.md) however,
you do not need to link your ip adress and server host name when adding it to you Windows terminal, only give the path
to the executable.

Also, inside dataHandler.hpp you need to give the base directory path for where the sessions will be stored. 

C++17 is required due to std::filesytem.
